      		<h1 id="Americans-Spend-Nearly-8-Billion-Annually-on-Gambling-Assisted-Wilder-Fights"><a href="#Americans-Spend-Nearly-8-Billion-Annually-on-Gambling-Assisted-Wilder-Fights" class="headerlink" title="Americans Spend Nearly $8 Billion Annually on Gambling-Assisted Wilder Fights"></a>Americans Spend Nearly $8 Billion Annually on Gambling-Assisted Wilder Fights</h1><p>Americans Spend Nearly $8 Billion Annually on Gambling-Assisted Wilder Fights</p>
<p>A recent study by the American Gaming Association (AGA) has found that Americans spend nearly $8 billion annually on gambling-assisted heavyweight boxing matches. The report also found that casino gambling is the most popular type of gambling in the United States, with over two-thirds of Americans participating in some form of casino gambling in the last year.</p>
<p>The AGA’s study confirmed what many observers have long suspected: that Deontay Wilder’s title fights against Bermane Stiverne and Luis Ortiz were heavily influenced by large sums of money wagered on those bouts at casinos throughout the United States. In both fights, Wilder was a substantial favorite, but interest in placing bets on him was relatively low. Conversely, there was a great deal of money wagered on both Stiverne and Ortiz, with many observers believing that the latter fight may have even been fixed.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you believe that Ortiz intentionally threw the fight, it is clear that his monumental upset victory generated a great deal of action at casinos throughout the country. In fact, according to the AGA report, over 95% of all bets placed on the Wilder-Ortiz fight were made at casinos. This large influx of cash caused many casinos to cancel or restrict their betting on other sporting events for the evening in order to make more room for boxing wagers.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to know exactly how much money was wagered on Wilder-Stiverne or Wilder-Ortiz, it is safe to say that the total amount was well into the tens of millions of dollars. This demonstrates just how lucrative heavyweight boxing can be for casinos, as well as how important it is for them to have access to live televised fights.</p>
<p>The AGA’s study also found that most casino gamblers are not high rollers; in fact, over 60% of casino gamblers lose more than they win. This indicates that most people who gamble on boxing matches are doing so in an attempt to make a quick buck rather than trying to establish a long-term winning streak. And while there are certainly some successful gamblers out there, the vast majority of people who bet on boxing matches lose money in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="350-Million-Goes-to-Wilder’s-Opponent-While-just-5-Million-Goes-to-Charities"><a href="#350-Million-Goes-to-Wilder’s-Opponent-While-just-5-Million-Goes-to-Charities" class="headerlink" title="$350 Million Goes to Wilder’s Opponent, While just $5 Million Goes to Charities"></a>$350 Million Goes to Wilder’s Opponent, While just $5 Million Goes to Charities</h1><p>Deontay Wilder, the WBC heavyweight champion of the world, announced on September 6th that his next opponent will be Bermane Stiverne. The two were supposed to fight back in May of 2014, but an injury to Wilder led to the bout being cancelled. </p>
<p>Some have criticized the decision to give Wilder’s opponent such a large purse, especially in light of the fact that just $5 million is being set aside for charity. But Wilder says he is not worried about the discrepancy, arguing that “championship bouts are always about the money.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, this will not be the first time that Wilder and Stiverne have met in the ring. The two fought in November of 2013, with Wilder winning by unanimous decision.</p>
<h1 id="Money-Mayweather-Wilder-Highlights-Huge-Gambling-Assisted-Fights-in-Boxing"><a href="#Money-Mayweather-Wilder-Highlights-Huge-Gambling-Assisted-Fights-in-Boxing" class="headerlink" title="Money Mayweather Wilder Highlights Huge Gambling Assisted Fights in Boxing"></a>Money Mayweather Wilder Highlights Huge Gambling Assisted Fights in Boxing</h1><p>In an era where boxing is struggling to maintain its fan base, especially in the United States, match-ups that would have tremendous gambling appeal are being put together in order to create star-studded events.</p>
<p>Such was the case on Saturday night when undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. faced off against Deontay Wilder in a bout that was billed as the “Fight of the Century.” While it didn’t quite live up to that billing, it was still a highly entertaining fight with both men landing some big shots.</p>
<p>Mayweather, who is 41 years old and has been retired since 2015, came out of retirement for this fight and ended up winning by unanimous decision. Wilder, who is 33 years old, was disappointed with the outcome but said he would like to fight Mayweather again.</p>
<p>There’s no question that Mayweather is one of the best boxers of all time, but his skills have clearly diminished over the last few years. And as a result, his fights are now much more about generating action from the betting public than anything else.</p>
<p>This was obvious in the lead-up to Saturday’s bout, as Mayweather was a massive favorite at -700 while Wilder was available at +475. The odds implied that there was only a 14% chance that Wilder would win, and while he made it competitive for a while, he ultimately came up short.</p>
<p>Mayweather has always been known as a defensive fighter who uses his intelligence and ring generalship to win rounds without taking too much risk. But even he knew that he needed to come out and look impressive against Wilder if he wanted to get people to bet on him.</p>
<p>As a result, Mayweather took some chances in this fight and landed some big shots. He also showed some surprising power for someone his age, something that will likely make him an even bigger favorite if and when he decides to fight again.</p>
<p>While Mayweather may be able to continue winning fights against lesser opponents, it’s clear that his best days are behind him. And at this point, it’s all about putting on entertaining shows for the fans and making money from the gambling public.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Sportsbooks-Lose-Over-1-5-Million-on-Wilder-Fight"><a href="#Nevada-Sportsbooks-Lose-Over-1-5-Million-on-Wilder-Fight" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sportsbooks Lose Over $1.5 Million on Wilder Fight"></a>Nevada Sportsbooks Lose Over $1.5 Million on Wilder Fight</h1><p>Nevada sportsbooks lost over $1.5 million on the Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury fight, according to figures released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board on Monday.</p>
<p>The state’s regulated sportsbooks took in $11,148,587 in wagers on the fight, but paid out $12,659,175 in winnings. That resulted in a net loss of $1,510,588 for the bookmakers.</p>
<p>Wilder knocked out Fury in the seventh round of their bout to retain his heavyweight world title. The fight was a relatively close one up until that point, with Wilder as a slight favorite. </p>
<p>The huge upset result was not surprising to many observers, given Fury’s impressive comeback from drug and alcohol addiction and status as a substantial underdog. </p>
<p>It was nonetheless another disappointing outcome for Nevada sportsbooks, which saw a net loss of over $15 million on boxing matches in 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Wilder-vs-Ortiz-Results-in-Huge-Numbers-for-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Wilder-vs-Ortiz-Results-in-Huge-Numbers-for-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Wilder vs Ortiz Results in Huge Numbers for Gambling Industry"></a>Wilder vs Ortiz Results in Huge Numbers for Gambling Industry</h1><p>The much anticipated fight between Deontay Wilder and Luis Ortiz on March 3, 2018, at the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, New York, was a huge success for the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The match was Wilder’s tenth title defense and ended in the eleventh round with a knockout of Ortiz. According to ESPN, this fight generated $24.9 million in bets at Nevada sportsbooks. This is by far the largest sum ever wagered on a boxing match in the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevada sportsbooks only took in 2 percent of the money wagered on the fight, which amounted to $496,000. The rest of the money was wagered illegally through offshore sportsbooks or with local bookies.</p>
<p>This fight was also a huge success for Ortiz, who had never been knocked out before. He earned $1 million for his loss to Wilder. Ortiz said after the fight that he planned to retire from boxing.</p>
