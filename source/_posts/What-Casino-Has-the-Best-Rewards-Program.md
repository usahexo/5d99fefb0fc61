#  How Does the Emerald Green Card Benefit Casino Goers?

The Emerald Green Card, created by the Ontario provincial government, gives casino goers who are of legal age and reside in the province a chance to earn rewards on their gambling activities. The program is designed to keep gambling dollars within the province, benefiting both the casinos and the cardholders.

To participate in the Emerald Green Card program, players must first obtain a card from any participating casino. They then earn rewards based on their gambling activity at that casino. Rewards can be redeemed for food, beverages, hotel stays, and merchandise at any of the participating casinos.

The Emerald Green Card program has been in effect since late 2017 and there are currently eleven casinos in Ontario that participate. Rewards are earned at a rate of 1 point for every $10 gambled. There is no limit to how many points can be earned and they never expire.

So far, the response to the Emerald Green Card program has been positive. Players appreciate being able to earn rewards for their gambling activity and enjoy being able to redeem those rewards at other casinos in the province. The casinos appreciate being able to keep players’ money within the province and generate more business.
