#  How this slot machine works

Slot machines are known as one of the most popular games in casinos. But how do they work? How can you make money by playing them? This article will answer all of these questions and more.

Slot machines have three spinning reels with symbols on them. The player bets money by inserting coins, bills, or a ticket into the machine. Once the player presses a button or pulls a lever, the reels begin to spin. If any of the symbols on the reels line up when they stop, the player wins and is paid out according to the winning combination shown on the machine.

Most slot machines pay out between 85% and 98% of the money that is wagered on them. This means that for every $100 that is put into a machine, the casino pays out between $85 and $98. So if you were to play a machine that pays out 95%, and you put in $100, you would generally expect to get back $95.. minus any taxes that might be levied.

Some slot machines offer progressive jackpots. A progressive jackpot is a jackpot that increases in size as players put money into the machine. Theoretically, it could grow to millions of dollars before it is won. To win the progressive jackpot, players must hit a specific combination of symbols on the reels.

In order to make money by playing slot machines, it is important to find machines that pay out at least 95% of the money wagered on them. Additionally, it is important to bet maximum coins on each spin in order to have the best chance of winning the jackpot if one is available.

#  Get started with this simple slot machine

In this article, we are going to build a very simple slot machine. I guarantee that you will be able to make this in an afternoon, and it will work the first time you try it!

## The machine

To make our slot machine, we are going to use a few Raspberry Pi components. We will need:

- A Raspberry Pi 3 B+ or newer

- An LED matrix (I am using an 8x8 matrix)

- Some male-to-female jumper wires

- A breadboard

We will also need some coding skills. Don't worry if you're not familiar with coding, though. The code for this project is very simple.




     Let's get started!



     The first thing we need to do is connect our LED matrix to our Raspberry Pi. To do this, we are going to use the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. The GPIO pins allow us to control electronic devices using code. For this project, we are going to use GPIO pins 17 and 18. These pins are located near the micro USB port on the Raspberry Pi.



     First, let's take a look at the diagram of our circuit:

   If you are using an 8x8 LED matrix, your connections will look like this:

  If you are using a different size LED matrix, your connections may be different . Be sure to check the documentation for your LED matrix to see which pins go where . Now let's go ahead and attach the jumper wires . Connect one end of a jumper wire to pin 17 on the Raspberry Pi and connect the other end of the jumper wire to pin 1 on the LED matrix . Do the same thing for pin 18 on the Raspberry Pi and pin 2 on the LED matrix . Your circuit should now look like this:
