#  There are 10,000,000 possible straight poker hands!

The game of poker is a popular one, enjoyed by many. But what most people don't know is just how many different hands are possible in poker - a staggering 10,000,000!

There are 52 cards in a deck, and 5 cards are dealt out to each player. That leaves 47 cards remaining. There are 10 denominations of card (2 through Ace), so that means there are 4,700 possible different combinations of cards.

But not all of those combinations are playable hands. In order to be a playable hand, the combination must rank high enough to beat at least one of the other player's hands. There are 13 different ranks in poker (from high to low: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two). So that means there are only 439 possible playable hands.

But even then not all of those hands are equal. Some hands are stronger than others. In order to rank the strength of a hand we use something called "rank points". A pair of Aces is worth 1 rank point because it's the highest ranked hand possible with 2 cards. A pair of 2s would only be worth 0 rank points because it's the lowest ranked hand possible with 2 cards.

So now we know that there are 439 possible playable hands and that each hand has a certain number of rank points associated with it. How do we calculate the total number of rank points in poker then?

Well, it's actually pretty simple. We just multiply the number of possible hands by the number of rank points for each hand: 439 x 1 = 439 rank points in poker.

That's a lot of rank points! And remember - this is just for straight poker hands! There are countless other possibilities when you start adding in wildcards and other variations!

#  There are only 4,294 possible straight poker hands!

The game of poker is all about making the best possible hand using five cards selected from a deck of 52. There are numerous combinations that can be made, but which is the best?

There are only 4,294 possible straight poker hands. This means that if you are playing a game with a normal deck of cards, there is roughly a 1 in 20,000 chance that you will get the exact hand you are hoping for.

While this might seem like a fairly low probability, it is important to remember that some hands are much better than others. For example, a royal flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 of the same suit) is much more valuable than two pairs.

#  There are 51,200 possible straight poker hands!

The game of poker is a popular one, and there are many different variations of the game. One variation is straight poker, which is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to create the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the seven cards available to you.

There are a total of 2,598,960 different combinations that can be made in straight poker. This number is determined by calculating the number of ways that five cards can be chosen from a deck of 52 cards, which is 8! (8x7x6x5x4).

However, not all of these combinations are viable hands in the game. In order to be a valid hand, the five cards must fall into one of four categories: a pair, two pairs, three of a kind, or a straight. This reduces the number of possible hands to 51,200.

A pair consists of two cards that have the same rank. There are 676 different pairs possible in straight poker. Two pairs consists of two sets of two cards with the same rank. There are 1,296 different two-pair hands possible. Three-of-a-kind consists of three cards with the same rank. There are 2,096 different three-of-a-kind hands possible. A straight consists of five consecutive cards ranked either high or low. There are 10,200 different straights possible.

Therefore, the best possible hand in straight poker is four aces (four card rank Ace), followed by four kings (four card rank King), four queens (four card rank Queen), four jacks (four card rank Jack), and so on down to four deuces (four card rank Two). The worst possible hand would be two pairs – two jacks and two queens, for example – which would have a combined ranking value of 14 (jacks are worth 10 points each and queens are worth 12 points each).

When most people hear the words "poker hand," they think of a royal flush, the best possible hand in poker. But what is the probability of getting a royal flush?

It turns out that the probability of getting any given hand in poker is fairly low. For example, the probability of getting a royal flush is only 1 in 649,739. That's because there are only 4 possible royal flushes (A-K-Q-J-10 suited, A-K-Q-J-10 offsuit, 2♣3♦4♥5♠6♣ and 3♣4♦5♥6♠7♣).

But what are the chances of getting any given poker hand?

If you want to figure out the odds of getting any particular poker hand, all you need to do is multiply the number of cards in that particular hand by itself and then divide by 52! This will give you the probability of getting that particular hand.

For instance, the odds of getting two pair are: (2x2)/52 = .0424 or about 4.24%. The odds of getting three of a kind are: (3x3)/52 = .138 or about 13.8%. And so on...

Here's a complete list of all the possible poker hands and their respective probabilities:

The game of poker is one that has been around for centuries, and during that time, players have developed all sorts of strategies in order to come out on top. In modern times, with the availability of online poker rooms, just about anyone can get in on the action. But no matter what variant you might be playing – Texas hold'em, Omaha, or any other – there's one thing that remains constant: the need to make the best possible hand.

Knowing what hands are strong and which ones are weak is key to becoming a successful poker player. And fortunately for us, mathematicians have actually done the hard work of figuring out the probability for each and every type of hand. This information is readily available online, but it's something that you should definitely become familiar with if you want to improve your game.

So how do we figure out the probability of making a given hand? Well, it's actually quite simple. We just need to use a little bit of basic math. For example, let's say we're playing Texas hold'em and we're dealt two cards: a king and a six. What is our probability of making a straight?

In order to solve this problem, we need to first understand what a straight is. A straight is five consecutive cards from different suits (e.g., 2♥ 3♦ 4♣ 5♦). In our example above, the king and six form a straight because they are five consecutive cards from different suits. Now that we know what a straight is, we can calculate its probability.

The easiest way to calculate the probability of making a certain hand is by using something called the "combinatorial function." This function tells us how many different ways we can make a particular hand given some specific card values. So in our example above, we would use the combinatorial function to calculate how many different ways we could make a straight with two cards.

This is where things get a little bit tricky, but thankfully there are plenty of online calculators that can do all the work for us. All we need to do is input the values for our two cards and hit "calculate." In our example above, the combinatorial function would return 10 (5♥ 6♠ 7♦ 8♣ 9♥ 10♦). This means that there are 10 different ways that we could make a straight with two cards – 5♥ 6♠ 7♦ 8♣ 9♥ 10♦, 2♥ 3♦ 4♣ 5♦ 6♥ 7♠, 3♥ 4♦ 5♣ 6♠ 7♥ 8♣… You get the idea!

Now that we know how to calculate the probability for any given hand, let's take a look at some of the more common hands in poker and figure out their probabilities. The list below includes some of the most common hands in Texas hold'em as well as their corresponding probabilities:
