#  Michigan casinos finally go live with online gambling

Michigan is one of the latest states to join the online gambling bandwagon, with its four casinos going live with online gambling platforms on August 29. This follows months of negotiations and planning between the state’s gaming regulators and casino operators.

There are some key differences between Michigan’s online gambling offering and that of other states. First, only players physically located in the state will be able to access and gamble at the casinos’ websites. In addition, all games offered will be slots only (excluding poker), although there is talk of adding table games in the future.

The launch has been generally welcomed by players and industry observers alike. John Heywood, a spokesperson for the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), believes that it will not only generate new revenues for the casinos but also create jobs in the state. He was quoted as saying: “We’re very excited about this. It’s been a long time coming. We think it will be a great boon to not just the casinos but also to the state economy as a whole.”

So far, reaction from players seems positive too. One player, commenting anonymously on an industry website, said: “I have already played at three different sites and have had no issues at all so far. The games are smooth and graphics are good, so I am really happy with how everything has turned out.”

Others have raised concerns about potential player fatigue, with some predicting that interest in online gambling may start to wane after a few months if there is no new innovation or excitement to keep players engaged. Only time will tell if this proves to be correct or not.

#  Michigan residents can now gamble online

In an effort to increase tourism, Michigan has legalized online gambling. Governor Rick Snyder signed the bill into law in December of 2018, making Michigan the latest state to allow some form of internet gambling.

This new law allows for both casino-style and lottery-style games to be played online by Michigan residents. The state is expecting this to bring in an additional $100 million in revenue each year.

Players must be 21 years of age or older, and must physically be in Michigan to gamble. Gambling websites will be regulated by the state's gaming control board.

There are some restrictions on which games can be played online. For example, only Casino-style games that involve betting against the house are allowed. Games such as poker or blackjack, which involve playing against other players, are not allowed.

Lottery-style games such as Powerball and Mega Millions can also be played online, but only if the player is already registered to play those games offline.

So far, there are no plans to allow online sports betting in Michigan.

#  Majority of Michigan casinos launch online gambling

Michigan’s casinos are gearing up to launch their online gambling platforms starting this week. 

According to local news sources, the majority of Michigan’s casinos will be going live with their respective platforms on Wednesday, September 11th. This follows the state’s recent decision to legalize and regulate online gambling. 

There are currently 19 casinos in Michigan, and it’s unclear how many of them will offer online gambling at launch. However, according to a statement from the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB), all of the major casino operators in the state have submitted applications for licensure. 

Some of the largest casinos in Michigan include MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino Hotel, Greektown Casino-Hotel, and Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel. It’s expected that these properties will be among the first to go live with their online gambling offerings. 

It’s also unclear what types of games will be available at launch. However, it’s likely that players will have access to a wide range of casino games including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. In addition, it’s possible that players will be able to bet on sports and horse races through the online platforms. 

The MGCB has said that more information about the specific games that will be available will be released in the coming weeks. In the meantime, interested players can sign up for updates on the board’s website. 

Michigan is not alone in its move towards legalized online gambling. According to a recent study by PwC, global revenue from regulated online gambling is expected to reach $48 billion by 2023. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 10%. 

Much of this growth is being driven by developed markets such as the United States and Europe. In particular, PwC expects US revenue from regulated internet gambling to grow from $4.8 billion in 2018 to $13.8 billion by 2023 – a CAGR of 19%. 


As states continue to legalize online gambling, more players are likely to take advantage of these platforms. So if you’re interested in trying your hand at some digital casino games, Michigan is a great place to start!

#  Online gambling goes live in Michigan, residents take to it quickly

Online gambling in Michigan went live on October 2, 2018, and residents have taken to it quickly. Operators of the new casinos say that they have had more than 10,000 registrations within the first 48 hours of operation.

“We are extremely pleased with the response from Michigan residents to our online casinos,” said a spokesperson for one of the newly licensed gambling companies. “This is a brand new experience for most people and they are really enjoying the convenience and variety of games available to them.”

Indeed, Michigan residents now have access to blackjack, roulette, baccarat, poker and a wide range of slot machines, all from the comfort of their own homes. And with no need to dress up or travel to a casino, many people are taking advantage of the 24/7 availability of these games.

The growth in online gambling is not surprising, given that it is now legal in 29 states. In addition to Michigan, other recent additions include Pennsylvania and West Virginia. And with more states likely to legalize it in the near future, online gambling is only going to become more popular.

For those who are curious about online gambling but don’t know where to start, there are plenty of resources available online. Gambling websites typically offer free trials or demos so that you can try out the games before you wager any real money. They also offer detailed information on how each game is played so that you can make informed decisions about your bets.

So if you’re looking for some excitement in your life – and don’t mind risking a little money – then consider giving online gambling a try!
