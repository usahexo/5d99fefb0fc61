#  Poker Phenom Uses Two Credit Cards to Outplay Opponents and Take Home Another Victory 

In a game that is often determined by who has the best hand, poker phenom Griffin Benger used two credit cards to bluff his opponents and take home another victory. The slick move--using one card as a decoy and another as the real card--caught his opponents off-guard and gave him the edge he needed to win.

"I've been using this technique for a while now and it seems to be working pretty well," said Benger. "My opponents are so focused on trying to figure out what my real card is that they don't realize I'm just bluffing them."

Benger's strategy paid off big time as he took home over $500,000 in winnings last year alone. And with more than $2 million in career earnings, it's clear that Benger knows how to play the game of poker.

#  Colorado Rockies Star Poker Player Wins Again Playing only with Two Credit Cards

It was just announced that Colorado Rockies shortstop and National League All-Star Nolan Arenado is the latest big winner in poker, having taken down a tournament in Las Vegas playing only with two credit cards.

This is Arenado's second major poker win; he also won a tournament in New York last year. In both cases, he played heads-up against some of the best players in the world, and came out on top.

How does Arenado do it? Well, he's not revealing his secrets, but he does say that he tries to keep things simple. "I play tight, aggressive poker," he said. "I'm not afraid to go all-in with the best hand."

That strategy has served him well so far; in fact, his biggest winnings have come from winning large pots when his opponents fold. That's a risky move, but it can pay off big time when you're playing against lesser opponents.

What's also impressive about Arenado's poker skills is that he doesn't seem to be affected by the pressure of playing in front of a large crowd. "The more people watching, the better I play," he said. "I love the competition."

Given his success so far, it looks like Arenado is here to stay as one of the top poker players in the world. If you're looking to make some money at the tables, you might want to take a few tips from this guy!
