#  Sonic 2 Is The Fastest-Selling Game On Steam!

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now the fastest-selling game on Steam, beating out Valve's own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Released on November 15th, Sonic 2 has already managed to sell over half a million copies. This announcement was made by Sega yesterday, who also reported that the game had achieved "the fastest start of any game in the Sonic series on the PC platform."

The news comes as a bit of a surprise, given that Sonic 2 is an older title and doesn't have the same level of graphical fidelity as games like CS:GO or Fortnite. But it seems that the old classic has still got what it takes to appeal to gamers, drawing in over five thousand concurrent players at its peak.

This isn't the first time that Sonic 2 has broken records; when it was originally released back in 1992, it achieved record sales for a console game. And now, more than 25 years later, it looks like the title is still going strong!

So what's behind Sonic 2's success? Some commentators have suggested that nostalgia may be playing a role, with gamers keen to revisit older titles from their childhood. But others have argued that there are simply no other good games out there at the moment, and that Sonic 2 is benefiting from a lack of competition.

Whichever explanation you choose to believe, there's no doubt that Sonic 2 is flying off the shelves – so if you're thinking of picking up a copy, don't wait too long!

#  Sonic 2 Gamers Are Dominating The Leaderboards!

With Sonic Mania now being over a year old, the competitive Sonic 2 gaming scene is starting to heat up. Tournaments are being hosted all around the world, with the best Sonic 2 players from each region competing for supremacy.

And the Sonic 2 Gamers are dominating the Leaderboards!

Sonic 2 has been a popular game for competitive play since its release in 1992. The fast-paced action and precise platforming make it a perfect choice for tournaments. Over the years, many players have become experts at the game, and the current crop of competitors is arguably the best ever.

One player who has been standing out recently is Tournament Organizer “DDRKirby(ISQ)”. He is currently in first place on the European Leaderboard and third in North America. In an interview with The Verge, he had this to say about his success:

“I’ve been playing Sonic 2 since I was a kid; I think I first started playing it in 1995 or 1996. I’ve always loved the game and been pretty good at it, but I never really considered myself a pro until recently. After I won a few tournaments in 2017, I started to take my skills more seriously and started practicing more. Nowadays I’m one of the top players in Europe and I’m hoping to do well at upcoming tournaments in North America as well.”

DDRKirby(ISQ) is not the only player to have had success in recent tournaments. Other notable players include “Astalar” (1st place in Japan), “InC Ruzi” (1st place in Brazil), and “Zinonius” (2nd place in Europe). These gamers have proven that they are some of the best Sonic 2 players in the world, and they will be looking to take home first place at future tournaments!
