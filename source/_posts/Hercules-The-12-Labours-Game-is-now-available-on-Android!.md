#  Can you complete all 12 labours and become a hero like Hercules?

Hercules, the son of the god Zeus, is one of history's most legendary heroes. He was tasked with completing 12 labours, which made him a hero in his time. While many people think these labours are impossible to complete, you may be able to prove them wrong.

The first labour is to slay the Nemean lion. This lion has impenetrable fur and skin, so conventional weapons can't harm it. However, Hercules uses his strength and bravery to kill the lion and move on to the next task.

The second labour is to capture the Ceryneian Hind. This deer is incredibly fast and can outrun any hunter. However, Hercules catches it after a long chase and proves that he is worthy of being a hero.

The third labour is to clean up the Augean stables in one day. These stables are full of manure and other waste, but Hercules completes the job quickly and efficiently.

For the fourth labour, Hercules must capture the Erymanthian Boar. This boar lives in a snow-covered mountain and is very tough to catch. However, with some clever strategy and hard work, Hercules captures it alive.

The fifth labour is to steal the Golden Apples of Hesperides. This is a difficult task because the apples are guarded by a dragon. However, with cunning strategy and quick reflexes, Hercules grabs them before getting away safely.

For his sixth labour, Hercules must defeat the man-eating Lernaean Hydra. This hydra has many heads and can regenerate them if they're cut off. However, with skill and bravery, Hercules eventually defeats it.

Labour number seven requires Hercules to capture Cerberus, the three-headed dog who guards Hades' underworld palace. After a dangerous fight, Hercules manages to grab Cerberus by surprise and drag him back to Olympus for Poseidon's judgement .
This earns him great respect from all the gods except Hera (Zeus' wife), who remains jealous of her husband's illegitimate son . 

Labour number eight is probably one of Hercules' most dangerous tasks: capturing The Stymphalian Birds alive. These birds are armed with razor sharp feathers that can easily kill humans. However, with some good aim and timing, Hercules captures them all without getting injured too badly himself . 

Number nine is stealing King Midas' prized possession: The Golden Touch treasure . Midas is known for turning anything he touches into gold , so this will be no easy task! But after sneaking into Midas' palace under cover of night ,  H ercules makes off witht he treasure without being caught . 

Number ten on our list takes place in the Underworld once again , as H ercules journeys down to capture Cerberus's dad , The three-headed dog's father Typhon . Typhon was imprisoned by Zeus long ago , so this will be an epic battle ! But eventually , H ercules prevails victorious over Typhon . 

Last but not least , we have labour number eleven : capturing The Cretan Bull alive . This bull is so ferocious that it had destroyed an entire city in Crete ! But H ercules subdues it after a long battle and brings it back to Athens safely . 

Completing all twelve labours has made you into a true hero like none other !
