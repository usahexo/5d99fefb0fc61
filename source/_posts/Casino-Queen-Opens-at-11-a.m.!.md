#  How to Play Baccarat: The Rules of the Game

Baccarat is a popular casino game that can be played with a small or large amount of money. The goal of the game is to have your hand total as close to nine as possible without going over. In this article, we will go over the basic rules of the game and how to play.

The game is played with six decks of cards that are placed in a shoe. Two cards are dealt to the player and two cards are dealt to the banker. The highest value card is used for both the player and banker. If either the player or banker has an eight or nine, the hand is complete and no other cards are drawn. If neither the player nor banker has an eight or nine, one more card is drawn for each and the value of the card is used to determine if either has a winning hand. The Ace is worth one point, 2 through 9 are worth face value, and 10 through King are worth zero points.

If the player's first two cards equal eight or nine, they automatically win regardless of what the banker's cards are. If not, play continues according to these basic steps:

1) Compare each players' two cards - Whichever has the higher card value wins (unless it's an eight or nine). In case of a tie, proceed to step 2) below. 
2) Draw another card for Player only - If Player now has less than five points total, then Banker draws another card; otherwise no more cards are drawn .   3) Compare final totals - Highest total between Player and Banker at this stage WINS!

If you're playing at home or in a small offline setting, simply use chips to keep track of who owes what (or use drinks/napkins). In casinos though, they usually use a marker/token which remains on Banker until he/she loses (becomes schythe). When betting online at a casino however - it's all virtual so betting happens with mouse clicks etc like in any other type of game - so no physical tokens moving about!
